## Overview

1up will develop a commmunity development portal to replace 

## Requirements

MVP = "exact duplicate of the existing portal, just with docusaurus as a framework instead of gitbooks"

1. Update home page, given new flexibility
   - It should be noted that docusaurus doesn't seem to have any ability to have the sidebar on the home page, so we should consider the new nav potential, as well 
1. Maintain Gitbooks documentation structure
1. Manageable CSS/Theme
1. Local Search
1. Subcategories do not collapse in sidebar

Later Version = "adding pages with arbitrary code. we have a transparency dashboard coming for the grants program that i'd like inside the portal as well"
